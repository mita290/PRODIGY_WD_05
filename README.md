# PRODIGY_WD_05

Task: To build a simple weather application that displays the temperature and climate conditions after accepting the location from the user.

This project utilizes Node.js for the backend, employing Express.js as the web framework. The frontend is rendered using EJS (Embedded JavaScript) templates. It integrates with APIs provided by Tomorrow.io for weather data retrieval, and manages secure handling of API keys using environment variables. A separate file has been created to interpret the climate descriptions given by Tomorrow.io. The data is given as 4-digit codes which have been mapped to their descriptions in English. The mapping was done by referring to the numerical codes Tomorrow.io has provided on their website. The application dynamically displays weather information based on user queries, ensuring efficient data delivery and user interaction.
